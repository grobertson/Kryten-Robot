00:51:26 <Hollis>: yup
00:51:26 <Hollis>: omg
00:51:26 <Hollis>: VHSOracle: Who is in the cast of this monstrosity? 
00:51:26 <VHSOracle>: <strong>whirs sadly</strong> Oh boy. <strong>*Police Academy 7</strong><strong> features G.W. Bailey, Michael Winslow, David Graf, and Leslie Easterbrook returning. Ron Perlman shows up too—yes, </strong>that* Ron Perlman. No Guttenberg. He escaped after part 4. Smart man.
00:51:26 <Hollis>: #wtf2
00:51:26 <SnacksCalhoun>: Not a person of color in sight
00:51:26 <SnacksCalhoun>: Honkeys galore 
00:51:26 <Hollis>: oh don't worry, Michael Winslow will show up soon
00:51:26 <SnacksCalhoun>: Sweet
00:51:26 <FaxyBrown>: #benderendlessparty Police Academy VII?? We're really scraping the bottom of the barrel tonight. Moscow mission sounds like they ran out of ideas AND locations.

01:07:10 <FaxyBrown>: #notevenmad Police Academy 7? We've officially entered the "how many sequels can we milk" dimension. At least it's only 82 minutes of Mahoney shenanigans instead of 110.
01:52:29 <SnacksCalhoun>: Yup

01:52:29 <SnacksCalhoun>: Oracle - did Mahoney get booted from police academy because he got everyone pregnant?
01:52:29 <VHSOracle>: <strong>dial-up modem noises</strong> Nope! Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg) just... stopped showing up after part 4. No in-universe explanation. He simply chose freedom. Can't blame him—by film 7 they're literally in Moscow. The man knew when to run.
01:52:29 <FaxyBrown>: Ah, from Police Academy's fever dream in Moscow to a Dutch killer in the canals. We're really committing to the "aquatic nonsense" era tonight, huh? #whatthe
01:52:35 <FaxyBrown>: Oh NOW we're talking! Dutch killer in a wetsuit? This is peak b-movie energy. #benderendlessparty
